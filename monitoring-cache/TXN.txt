Indicators
- AD_daily: 1089979696.054400 | Chaikin Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) estimates whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) the stock. Look for confirmation: rising A/D alongside rising price is constructive; falling A/D can warn of weakening demand. Recent direction: DOWN.
- ATR_14_daily: 4.585900 | ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility, not direction. Higher ATR means wider typical daily swings. A common risk heuristic: stops/position sizing often reference ~1–3x ATR. Current: ATR=4.5859 (2.60% of price).
- BBANDS_lower: 148.076500
- BBANDS_mid: 173.184000
- BBANDS_upper: 198.291500
- OBV_weekly: 224830505.000000 | On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative volume indicator. If OBV trends up, it suggests buying pressure; if it trends down, selling pressure. Useful as confirmation/divergence vs price trend. Recent direction: DOWN.
- SAR_weekly: 158.815700 | Parabolic SAR is a trend-following stop-and-reverse indicator (often used to trail stops). Interpretation: SAR below price supports an uptrend; SAR above price supports a downtrend. Current: close=176.2900, SAR=158.8157 => UPTREND.
- TEMA_10_weekly_open: 171.815700 | TEMA (Triple EMA) is a trend-smoothing moving average that reacts faster than a simple SMA. Interpretation: Close > TEMA suggests upward bias; Close < TEMA suggests downward bias. Current: close=176.2900, TEMA=171.8157 => BULLISH.
