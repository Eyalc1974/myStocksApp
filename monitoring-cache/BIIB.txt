Indicators
- AD_daily: 135056372.161500 | Chaikin Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) estimates whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) the stock. Look for confirmation: rising A/D alongside rising price is constructive; falling A/D can warn of weakening demand. Recent direction: UP.
- ATR_14_daily: 5.383000 | ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility, not direction. Higher ATR means wider typical daily swings. A common risk heuristic: stops/position sizing often reference ~1–3x ATR. Current: ATR=5.3830 (3.08% of price).
- BBANDS_lower: 167.195500
- BBANDS_mid: 177.518000
- BBANDS_upper: 187.840500
- OBV_weekly: 982788884.000000 | On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative volume indicator. If OBV trends up, it suggests buying pressure; if it trends down, selling pressure. Useful as confirmation/divergence vs price trend. Recent direction: UP.
- SAR_weekly: 165.288000 | Parabolic SAR is a trend-following stop-and-reverse indicator (often used to trail stops). Interpretation: SAR below price supports an uptrend; SAR above price supports a downtrend. Current: close=174.8000, SAR=165.2880 => UPTREND.
- TEMA_10_weekly_open: 181.079500 | TEMA (Triple EMA) is a trend-smoothing moving average that reacts faster than a simple SMA. Interpretation: Close > TEMA suggests upward bias; Close < TEMA suggests downward bias. Current: close=174.8000, TEMA=181.0795 => BEARISH.
