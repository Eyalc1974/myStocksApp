Indicators
- AD_daily: 81505293475.606600 | Chaikin Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) estimates whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) the stock. Look for confirmation: rising A/D alongside rising price is constructive; falling A/D can warn of weakening demand. Recent direction: UP.
- ATR_14_daily: 5.019300 | ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility, not direction. Higher ATR means wider typical daily swings. A common risk heuristic: stops/position sizing often reference ~1–3x ATR. Current: ATR=5.0193 (1.81% of price).
- BBANDS_lower: 266.129900
- BBANDS_mid: 275.912000
- BBANDS_upper: 285.694100
- OBV_weekly: 260478536338.000000 | On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative volume indicator. If OBV trends up, it suggests buying pressure; if it trends down, selling pressure. Useful as confirmation/divergence vs price trend. Recent direction: DOWN.
- SAR_weekly: 270.900000 | Parabolic SAR is a trend-following stop-and-reverse indicator (often used to trail stops). Interpretation: SAR below price supports an uptrend; SAR above price supports a downtrend. Current: close=278.0300, SAR=270.9000 => UPTREND.
- TEMA_10_weekly_open: 280.046600 | TEMA (Triple EMA) is a trend-smoothing moving average that reacts faster than a simple SMA. Interpretation: Close > TEMA suggests upward bias; Close < TEMA suggests downward bias. Current: close=278.0300, TEMA=280.0466 => BEARISH.
