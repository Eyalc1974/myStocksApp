Indicators
- AD_daily: -514435268.899900 | Chaikin Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) estimates whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) the stock. Look for confirmation: rising A/D alongside rising price is constructive; falling A/D can warn of weakening demand. Recent direction: UP.
- ATR_14_daily: 15.716900 | ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility, not direction. Higher ATR means wider typical daily swings. A common risk heuristic: stops/position sizing often reference ~1–3x ATR. Current: ATR=15.7169 (5.91% of price).
- BBANDS_lower: 181.826000
- BBANDS_mid: 237.626000
- BBANDS_upper: 293.426000
- OBV_weekly: 6265798830.000000 | On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative volume indicator. If OBV trends up, it suggests buying pressure; if it trends down, selling pressure. Useful as confirmation/divergence vs price trend. Recent direction: UP.
- SAR_weekly: 196.198000 | Parabolic SAR is a trend-following stop-and-reverse indicator (often used to trail stops). Interpretation: SAR below price supports an uptrend; SAR above price supports a downtrend. Current: close=265.9200, SAR=196.1980 => UPTREND.
- TEMA_10_weekly_open: 250.945400 | TEMA (Triple EMA) is a trend-smoothing moving average that reacts faster than a simple SMA. Interpretation: Close > TEMA suggests upward bias; Close < TEMA suggests downward bias. Current: close=265.9200, TEMA=250.9454 => BULLISH.
