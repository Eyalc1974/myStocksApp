    "TEMA_10_weekly_open" : "TEMA (Triple EMA) is a trend-smoothing moving average that reacts faster than a simple SMA. Interpretation: Close > TEMA suggests upward bias; Close < TEMA suggests downward bias. Current: close=76.2600, TEMA=74.9296 => BULLISH.",
    "SAR_weekly" : "Parabolic SAR is a trend-following stop-and-reverse indicator (often used to trail stops). Interpretation: SAR below price supports an uptrend; SAR above price supports a downtrend. Current: close=76.2600, SAR=70.9140 => UPTREND.",
    "ATR_14_daily" : "ATR (Average True Range) measures volatility, not direction. Higher ATR means wider typical daily swings. A common risk heuristic: stops/position sizing often reference ~1–3x ATR. Current: ATR=1.4314 (1.88% of price).",
    "BBANDS" : "Bollinger Bands describe a volatility envelope around a moving average (middle band). Interpretation: price near upper band suggests strength; near lower band suggests weakness; mid band is the mean. Current: close=76.2600. Close is between mid and upper band (moderate bullish bias).",
    "AD_daily" : "Chaikin Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) estimates whether volume is flowing into (accumulation) or out of (distribution) the stock. Look for confirmation: rising A/D alongside rising price is constructive; falling A/D can warn of weakening demand. Recent direction: UP.",
    "OBV_weekly" : "On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative volume indicator. If OBV trends up, it suggests buying pressure; if it trends down, selling pressure. Useful as confirmation/divergence vs price trend. Recent direction: UP."
